Selenium Page Object Generator
==============================

A nimble and flexible [Selenium Page Object Model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) generator to improve [agile testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_testing) [process velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(software_development)).

Selenium Page Object Generator is an essential tool to improve your workflow. It will generate [Page Object Model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) on active [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) tab with a single click, provided that all of the options and template are configured. The generated Page Object Model will be saved to pre-configured Chrome or Opera download folder.

Selenium Page Object Generator is also available in command line by installing [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) package from [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-page-object-generator).

The template is using [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) expression, a clean logic-less semantic templating language.

This is an early BETA release, it expected to have rough edges, and limited functionality. It currently support 3 different targets: [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), and [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/).

The template is using [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) expression, a clean logic-less semantic templating language. This solution was forked and reworked on github: [https://github.com/rickypc/selenium-page-object-generator](https://github.com/rickypc/selenium-page-object-generator). 

This is an early release, it expected to have rough edges, and limited functionality. It currently support 2 different targets: [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), and [Groovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_(programming_language)) but can be easily ported to any other language.

You need Node.JS 5+ to try this out.

Installation
-

- [Install *node.js* and *npm*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Be sure to have node.js version 5+. On GNU/Linux, repositories can be outdated, so a simple ```apt-get install``` might not be enough to get the right version. 
- Clone the repo.
- Open a terminal/cdm.
- In the terminal go to the repo directory that you just cloned. For example on Windows:
```bash
$ cd "C:\Your\Project\Folder\selenium-page-object-generator" 
```
- Run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install
```
 This will install all the necesary modules required on the package.json file.

  -v, --version                              Show program's version number and exit.
  -t, --target {cs,java,robotm, groovy}      Generator target
  -n, --name [PageName]                      Page name (no-spaces)
  -d, --destination [DestinationPageName]    Destination page name (no-spaces) (optional)
